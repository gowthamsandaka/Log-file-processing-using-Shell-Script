# Log-file-processing-using-Shell-Script
I write a script that processes a log file and extracts useful information summaries from it, a task that is common in system administration work. The log file is a web server log file from the small, portable and secure web server thttpd1. It follows a standard format that is common in the UNIX world, that is, itâ€™s a flat text file with one record per line and fields delimited by whitespace or other characters.
